[Intro]
A  E  B   E

[Verse 1]
E
Well the road was hot and flat as a ruler
     A
Good hundred miles between me and Missoula
     B
That vinyl top were'nt gettin' no cooler
                          E
So I stopped at a Quickie Sack
E
Cuz I figured I'd need about a six of Miller
    A
And one of them things so I wouldn't spill her
   B
So I asked the girl if the beer was in the back


[Chorus]
         B
She said "It's a dry town
                      E
No beer no liquor for miles around"
                        A
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
   E
To wash me down
B              E
Outta this dry town
A  E  B   E

[Verse 2]
E
So I turn right around, no hesitation
  A
Cursed the laws ruinin' the nation
B
Waved goodbye to the boy at the station
                         E
But she wouldn't go into gear

E
He said it sounds like your transmission
     A
You need to Bob, but he's gone fishin'
   B
On his day off, he gets a long way from here


[Chorus]
         B
Cause "It's a dry town
                      E
No beer no liquor for miles around"
                        A
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
   E
To wash me down
B              E
Outta this dry town
A  E  B   E


[Instrumental]
E   A   B       E  (2X)


[Verse 3]
     E
Well back home friends you can get a dose
   A
Of something strong from a local grocer
   B
So I walked down till I come closer
                  E
To a place called Happy Johns

E
He said "I keep something for colds and fevers
A
Down under here is where I usually leave her
B
But just last night I felt a cold a comin' on"


[Chorus]
         B
Now "It's a dry town
                      E
No beer no liquor for miles around"
                        A
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
   E
To wash me down
B              E
Outta this dry town
         A
I need a sip or two
   E
To wash me down
B              A     E
Outta this dry------ town
A  E  B   E
