Achy Breaky Heart
Billy Ray Cyrus


[Riff]

A - E - A


[Verse 1]

A
You can tell the world

You know there was no girl
                                  E
You can burn my clothes when I am gone

Or you can tell your friends

Just what a fool I've been
                                   A
And laugh and joke about me on the phone


[Verse 2]

You can tell my arms
Go back into the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips
To tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

[Chorus]    A
        But don't tell my heart

        My achy breaky heart
                                     E
        I just don't think it'd understand

        And if you tell my heart

        My achy breaky heart
                                       A
        He might blow up and kill this man

Uuuuuuu..


[Verse 3]

You can tell your maw
I moved to Arcansa(s)
You can tell your dog that bit my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff
Who's fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway


[Verse 4]

Go tell your aunt Louise
Tell anything you please
That sell already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eye
Whatch out for my mind
It might be walkin' out on me one day
[Chorus]    A
        But don't tell my heart

        My achy breaky heart
                                     E
        I just don't think it'd understand

        And if you tell my heart

        My achy breaky heart
                                       A
        He might blow up and kill this man

Uuuuuuu..

[Chorus]    A
        But don't tell my heart

        My achy breaky heart
                                     E
        I just don't think it'd understand

        And if you tell my heart

        My achy breaky heart
                                       A
        He might blow up and kill this man

Uuuuuuu..

[Chorus]    A
        But don't tell my heart

        My achy breaky heart
                                     E
        I just don't think it'd understand

        And if you tell my heart

        My achy breaky heart
                                       A
        He might blow up and kill this man

Uuuuuuu..
