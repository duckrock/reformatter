Turtles All The Way Down Chords By Sturgill Simpson @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com
[Verse]
Ive seen [E]Jesus play with flames, in a lake of fire
That I was standing in [A]      [Asus4]        [A]  [Asus4]      
Met the[B7] devil in Seattle
And spent nine months inside the lions... [E]den      [Esus4]        [E]     [Esus4]      
Met[E] Buddha yet another time
And he showed me the glowing light within [A]     [Asus4]        [A]   [Asus4]      
[B7] But I swear that God is there, every time I glare
Into the eyes of my best... [E]friend       [Esus4]         [E]     [Esus4]      
[Refrain]
[A] Says my son, its all been done
Someday youre gonna wake up old and... gray [E]         [Esus4]        [E] [Esus4]      
So[A] go and try to have some fun, showing warmth to everyone 
You meet and greet... and cheat along the way    [B7]    [d[(walk]own)]      
Theres a [E]gateway in our minds that leads somewhere out there
Far beyond this pla[A]ne     [Asus4]        [A]   [Asus4]      
Where[B7] reptile aliens made of light
Cut you open, pull out all your pai[E]n      [Esus4]        [E]   [Esus4]      
Tell me[E] how you make illegal
Something that we all make in our bra[A]in      [Asus4]        [A]   [Asus4]      
Some[B7] say you might go crazy
Then again, it might make you go... [E]sane      [Esus4]        [E] [Esus4]      
[A] Every time I... take a look... inside that old and... fabled book 
Im [A]blinded and... reminded of...
The pain caused by some old man in the sky    [E]     [Esus4]     [Es[E]us4]      
[A] Marijuana... LSD... psilocybin... DMT...
[A] They all changed... the way I see... 
But loves t[A]he only thing... that ever saved my life    [B7]    [d[(walk]own)]      
So, dont [E]waste your mind on nursery rhymes or fairy tales of blood and wine 
Its turt[A]les all the way [G#m]down the [F#m]line 
So to[A] each their own til we go home... to other realms our souls must roam 
To [A]and through... the myth that... we all call... spa[B7]ce and[E] time
