Keep It Between The Lines Chords - Sturgill Simpson - Cowboy Lyrics
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
[A]Dont turn mailboxes into baseballs
[A]Dont get busted selling at seventeen
[E]Most thoughts deserve two or three more
[A]Motor oil is motor oil, just keep the engine clean
[E]Keep your eyes on the prize, everything will be fine
[A]Stay in school, stay off the hard stuff and keep between the lines
[Verse 2]
[A]Dont burn two lanterns at the same time
No[A] ship out on the water will pay your rent
Cause you[E] live and you learn, sometimes you get burned
When your get[A] out done got up walked out the door and went
[E]Do as I say, dont do as Ive done
[A]It dont have to be like father, like son
[Solo]
[E   A]
[E   A][A]
[Verse 3]
[A]Dont let them try to upsell you
Theres a [A]reason they make chocolate and vanilla, too
If theres [E]any doubt, then there is no doubt, the gut dont never lie
And the[A] only word you\ll ever need to know in life is why
Keep your[E] head out of the clouds and remember to be kind
And just[A] stay in school, stay off of the drugs and keep between the lines
[Outro]
[A]Dont, dont sweat the small stuff
[A]Cant sweat the small stuff
[A]Dont sweat the small stuff
