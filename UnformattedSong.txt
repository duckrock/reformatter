[Verse]

G
Rise and shine, get out of bed
Em
Get ready for the day
A
Get a coffee from the deli
D               D7
And walk the riverbank
G
Be careful with your headphones on
Em
When you cross the FDR
A
Don't want to be a casualty
D                        D7
Before you make it to the bar
G                               F
And hide your shakes and worried face
Em                   C
Just sit down in the back
A
Your friends got there ahead of you
D                   D7
And night is falling fast

[Chorus]

C                         D
Oh, you know you shouldn't say it
          Bm               Em
So you're thinking it out loud
C                    D         
Some things we lost are 
              Em     Em B/D# Bm/D
never to be found
C                        D
But if you're gonna talk like that
    G                 Em
At least buy another round
                   A                 C             G
And we can keep drinking till St. Dymphna kicks us out

[Verse]

G
This world is made of blinking lights
Em
They're changing all the time
A
But depending who you're talking to
D                  D7
It's likely to be fine
G
I watched you go from bad to worse
Em
The blues is here to stay
A
Sometimes it's the simple things 
D                 D7
that make it all okay
G                             F
Oh, you don't have to lie, say you're alright
Em                           C
We're just happy that you're here
A
But if you yell and tell me to go to hell
D                           D7
Well at least you'd sound sincere

[Chorus]

C                          D
Oh, you know it's all a spectacle
Bm                    Em
When you go to take a bow
C                    D            Em   Em B/D# Bm/D
You always did get nervous in a crowd
C                       D
But if you need some company
G                 Em
I'd gladly stick around
                    A                C              G
And we can keep drinking till St. Dymphna kicks us out

[Bridge]

Am           Bm
Let's get enabled
C                        D
Great minds, they think alike
Am              Bm
I never was a good judge of when
C              D    D7
to call it a night

[Chorus]

C                       D
Oh, you don't have to say it
           Bm              Em
So you're thinking it out loud
C                 D
Some things go south and they 
             Em      Em B/D# Bm/D
never turn around
C                     D
But if you want a confidant
G                   Em
I'd never let you down
                    A               C               G
Oh, we can keep drinking till St. Dymphna kicks us out
                    A               C                G
Yes, we can keep drinking till St. Dymphna kicks us out
