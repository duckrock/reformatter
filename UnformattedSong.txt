Am G F E x4


[Verse]

            Am      G      F             E
There was a red sun rising early in this ghetto 
Am            G      F          E
Full moon was rising late last night    
    Am            G                 F    E
But you would not know, no you were fast asleep 
    Am           G       F   E         Am   G  F
You only see the city in the broad daylight 
       E         Am   G  F  E
In the broad daylight 


[Chorus]

   Am   G  F  E
Fogtown, 
   Am     G       F            E
fogtown, down and out on your streets   
        Am        G         F        E
I would run if I only had a place to run to 
       Am    G  F  E
In old Fogtown

[Verse]


             Am         G         F         E
Her name was Ruby Red, she was a two-bit hooker 
          Am         G                F         E
She had a man named Juan who tried to keep her clean    
    Am        G              F           E
But late last night when the heroin took her    
          Am       G              F      E           Am    G  F
There was one less siren when the sirens reached the scene      
E           Am    G  F  E
Reached the scene       


[Chorus]

   Am   G  F  E
Fogtown, 
   Am     G       F            E
fogtown, down and out on your streets   
        Am        G         F        E
I would run if I only had a place to run to 
       Am    G  F  E
In old Fogtown

[Verse]

          Am            G           F         E
Well the city's got the charms of a painted lady        
     Am      G            F            E
And survival bites like a black-headed bitch    
        Am        G          F          E
You can find yourself on the closest corner     
 Am                            G              F E       Am    G  F
You want to stay, you want to go you've got the Fogtown itch    
                E      Am    G  F  E
You've got the Fogtown itch     


[Chorus]

   Am   G  F  E
Fogtown, 
   Am     G       F            E
fogtown, down and out on your streets   
        Am        G         F        E
I would run if I only had a place to run to 
       Am    G 
In old Fogtown  
F                   E        Am  G  F  
You're gonna be the death of me 
E        Am
Death of me
