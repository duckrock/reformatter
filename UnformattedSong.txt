I am working on a complete tab for this entire album but wanted to get chords out there in case anyone wants
to start jamming on these songs... They all need to be listened to as a whole, for sure!

[Intro]
A


[Verse 1]
A
Don't turn mailboxes into baseballs
A
Don't get busted selling at seventeen
E
Most thoughts deserve two or three more
A
Motor oil is motor oil, just keep the engine clean
E
Keep your eyes on the prize, everything will be fine
A
Stay in school, stay off the hard stuff and keep between the lines


[Verse 2]
A
Don't burn two lanterns at the same time
   A
No ship out on the water will pay your rent
          E
Cause you live and you learn, sometimes you get burned
              A
When your get out done got up walked out the door and went
E
Do as I say, don't do as I've done
A
It don't have to be like father, like son


[Solo]
A
E   A
E   A
A


[Verse 3]
A
Don't let them try to upsell you
          A
There's a reason they make chocolate and vanilla, too
           E
If there's any doubt, then there is no doubt, the gut don't never lie
        A
And the only word you'll ever need to know in life is "why"
          E
Keep your head out of the clouds and remember to be kind
         A
And just stay in school, stay off of the drugs and keep between the lines


[Outro]
A
Don't, don't sweat the small stuff
A
Can't sweat the small stuff
A
Don't sweat the small stuff
