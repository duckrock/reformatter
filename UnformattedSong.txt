D
Talkin' to myself again
                                 A
Wondering if this travelin' is good
                                                     D
Is there something better doin we'd be doin if we could?

(CHORUS)
   G          A             D
And oh the stories we could tell
   G          A             D
And if this all blows up and goes to hell
   G          A             D             G
I can still see us sittin on the bed in some motel
D               A               D
Listenin' to the stories we could tell

D
Remember that guitar in a museum in Tennessee
                                                A
And the nameplate on the glass brought back twenty melodies
          D
And the scratches on the face
          G
Told of all the times he fell
 D              A            D
Singin' every story he could tell

(CHORUS)
G             A           D
And oh the stories it could tell
G                      A            D 
And I bet you it still rings like a bell
G                  A               D           G
And I wish we could sit back on the bed in some motel
D                   A              D
And listen to the stories we could tell
-------------------------------------------------------
D
So if you're on the road tracking down here every night
                                                           A
And you're singin' for a livin' 'neath the brightly colored lights
D                               G
And if you ever wonder why you ride this carousel
D                   A               D
You did it for the stories you could tell
