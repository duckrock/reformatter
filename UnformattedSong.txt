              E 
    I've seen Jesus play with flames, in a lake of fire
                        A     Asus4   A     Asus4 
    That I was standing in
            B7 
    Met the devil in Seattle
                                           E        Esus4   E        Esus4
    And spent nine months inside the lions... den 
    
        E 
    Met Buddha yet another time
                                           A    Asus4   A      Asus4 
    And he showed me the glowing light within 
    B7 
    But I swear that God is there, every time I glare
                             E            Esus4    E        Esus4 
    Into the eyes of my best... friend

        A 
        Says my son, it's all been done
                                             E        Esus4   E        Esus4 
        Someday you're gonna wake up old and... gray
           A 
        So go and try to have some fun, showing warmth to everyone 
                                                  B7    (walk down)
        You meet and greet... and cheat along the way
  
              E 
    There's a gateway in our minds that leads somewhere out there
                    A      Asus4   A      Asus4 
    Far beyond this plane 
          B7 
    Where reptile aliens made of light
                                    E      Esus4   E      Esus4 
    Cut you open, pull out all your pain 
    
            E 
    Tell me how you make illegal
                                      A       Asus4   A      Asus4 
    Something that we all make in our brain
         B7 
    Some say you might go crazy
                                     E         Esus4   E    Esus4 
    Then again, it might make you go... sane 
       
        A 
        Every time I... take a look... inside that old and... fabled book 
            A 
        I'm blinded and... reminded of...
                                               E    Esus4   E    Esus4 
        The pain caused by some old man in the sky
        A 
        Marijuana... LSD... psilocybin... DMT...
        A 
        They all changed... the way I see... 
            A                                           B7    (walk down)
        But love's the only thing... that ever saved my life 
              E 
    So, don't waste your mind on nursery rhymes or fairy tales of blood and wine 
         A               G#m          F#m 
    It's turtles all the way down the line 
          A 
    So to each their own til' we go home... to other realms our souls must roam 
    A                                                 B7        E 
    To and through... the myth that... we all call... space and time
                                                (let final chord ring)
