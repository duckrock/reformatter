Tupelo Chords - Jason Isbell - Cowboy Lyrics
[Verse 1]
[G]Havent been wasted in a long[C] time
[G]But tonight it feel[C]s just fine
Riding[Am] home with windows up
a[Em]lone with a plastic cup of [D]real good wine
[Chorus]
When I ge[G]t out of this hole Im going to[C] Tupelo
There is a[G] girl out there that will treat m[D]e fair
Get about [G]a week of spring and the summer i[C]s blistering
There[Am] aint no one from[Dsus2] here that will follow [Em]me there
No there[Am] aint no one from [D]here that will follow me [G]there
[C   G   C]
[Verse 2]
[G]She said theres nothin left to talk [C]about
[G]At my age I should have fig[C]ured out
Which[Am] drawer to put the good knives in
and the[Em] wars between weekends tore our[D] playhouse down
[Verse 3]
[G]Kept her close but way too c[C]lose to me
[G]She never lived up to my m[C]emory
Driving[Am] fast with the windows down
A [Em]past I dont belong to now, a[D] mystery
[Chorus]
When I ge[G]t out of this hole Im going to[C] Tupelo
There is a[G] girl out there that will treat m[D]e fair
Get about [G]a week of spring and the summer [C]is blistering
There[Am] aint no one from[Dsus2] here that will follow [Em]me there
No there[Am] aint no one from [D]here that will follow me [G]there
[Bm G][Bm C C]
[Chorus]
When I ge[G]t out of this hole Im [G/B]going to [C]Tupelo
There is a[G] girl out there that will treat m[D]e fair
Get about [G]a week of spring and the summer [C]is blistering
