Constellations Chords (Ver 3) By Jack Johnson @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com
[When playing a G in the verses, you can hammer on/pull off to the 5th and 2nd fret of the high E string]
[Verse]
[G]The light was leaving and the west it was blue
[C]The childrens laughter sang
[G]And skipping just like the stones they threw
[C]Their voices echoed across the way
[D7]Its getting late
[Chorus]
[G]It was[F] just anothe[C]r night
With a[D] sunset
And a[G] moonrise[F] not so fa[C]r behind
To give us [D]just enough light
To [G]lay down [F]underneath the[C] stars
Listen t[D]o papas translations
[G]Of the [F]stories across th[C]e sky
We drew our [D]own constellations
[Verse]
[G]The west winds often last too long
[C]The wind may calm down nothing ever feels the same
[G]Sheltered under the Kamani tree
[C]Waiting for the passing rain
[G]Clouds keep moving to uncover the scene
[C]Stars above us chasing the day away
[G]To find the stories that we sometimes need
[C]Listen close enough
[D7]All else fades, fades away
[Chorus]
[G]It was[F] just anothe[C]r night
With a[D] sunset
And a[G] moonrise[F] not so fa[C]r behind
To give us [D]just enough light
To [G]lay down [F]underneath the[C] stars
Listen t[D]o all the translations
[G]Of the [F]stories across th[C]e sky
We drew our [D]own constellations
