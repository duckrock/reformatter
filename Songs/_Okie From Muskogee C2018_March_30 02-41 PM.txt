Okie From Muskogee Chords - Kris Kristofferson - Cowboy Lyrics
We dont smoke o[C]ur draft cards in Muskogee 
All all we ever drops are [G7] BBDs 
We dont known no hippies queers or c[C]ommies 
Cause [F]we like livin r[G7]ight and bein f[C]ree 
And Im p[F]roud to be an Okie from Mu[C]skogee 
A place where even squares can have a [G7]ball 
[F] We still wave Old Glory down at the [C]courthouse 
And [F]White Lightnins still the [G7]biggest thrill of [C]all 
[C] We do lots of lovin in Muskogee 
We aint never heard of pitchin w[G7]oo 
We dont shoot that deadly marij[C]uana 
[F] We get drunk like [G7]God wants us to [C]do 
And Im p[F]roud to be an Okie from Musk[C]ogee 
A place where even squares can have a [G7]ball 
[F] We still wave Old Glory down at the c[C]ourthouse 
And W[F]hite Ligthnins still the [G7]biggest thrill of a[C]ll 
In [F]Muskogee Okl[G7]ahoma U [C]S A
