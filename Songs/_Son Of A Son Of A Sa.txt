Son Of A Son Of A Sailor Chords By Jimmy Buffett @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com
[Intro]
[E, D, A, E     E, D, A, E,]
[Verse]
As the[E] son of a son of a sailor
I went[D] out on the[A] sea for a[E]dventure
E[A]xpanding the view of the[E] captain and crew
like a[B] man just released from i[E]ndentured
As a[E] dreamer of dreams and a travelin man
I have[D] chalked up[A] many a[E] mile.
Read[A] dozens of books about[E] heroes and crooks
and I[B] learned much from both of their s[E]tyles.
[Chorus]
[D]Son of a son,[A] Son of a son
Son of a son of a[E] sailor
[D]Son of a gun,[A] Load the last ton
One step ahead of the[E] jailor
[Verse]
Now[E] way in the near future,
[D]Southeast[A] of di[E]sorder
You can[A] shake the hand of the ma[E]ngo man
As he[B] greets you at the[E] border
And the[E] lady she hails from trinidad,
[D]Island[A] of the[E] spices
[A]Salt for your meat, and[E] cinnamon sweet
And the[B] rum is for all your good[E] vices.
[Bridge]
[D]Haul the sheet in as we[A] ride on the wind
That our fore-fathers harnessed b[E]efore us
[D]Hear the bells ring as the[A] tide rigging sings
[E]
[Its a son of a gun of a chorus]
[Solo]
[D, A, E]
[D, A, E]
[Verse]
Now[E] where it all ends, I cant fathom my friends
If I[D] knew I might[A] toss out my[E] anchor
[A]So Ill cruise along always [E]searching for songs
Not a[B] lawyer, a thief or a[E] banker
[Chorus]
[D]But a son of a son,[A] son of a son
Son of a son of a[E] sailor
[D]Son of a gun,[A] load the last ton
One step ahead of the[E] jailor
[Outro]
[D]Im just a son of a son, [A]son of a son
Son of a son of a[E] sailor
The[D] seas in my veins, my tra[A]dition remains
Im just glad I dont live in a t[E]railer
