[Verse 1]
I went [Dm]down to[A7] St.James In[Dm]firmary

[Verse 2]
Let her[Dm] go, let her[A7] go, God[Dm] bless her
[Dm]Wherever sh[Bb7]e may[A7] be
She can [Dm]look this [A7]wide world [Dm]over
But shell n[Bb7]ever find a sweet [A7]man like [Dm]me 
[Verse 3]
When I[Dm] die bury[A7] me in strait laced [Dm]shoes,
[Dm]I want a Boxback coat and[Bb7] a Stetson [A7]hat
