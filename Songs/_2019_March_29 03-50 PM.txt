[C](Lalala ya lala[F]la yayaya[G]yayayay)
[C](Lalala ya lala[F]la yayaya[G]yayayay)
[C](Lalala ya lala[F]la yayaya[G]yayayay)
[C](Lalala ya lala[F]la yayaya[G]yayayay)
[C] (Co-conut coc[F]ocococon[G]ut – co[C]conucat)
(Co-conut co[F]cocococo[G]nut – co[C]conut)
(Co-conut co[F]cocococo[G]nut – co[C]conut)
(Co-conut co[F]cocococo[G]nut – co[C]conut)
[C                F]
The [C]coconut nut is a [F]giant nut
If you [G]eat too much, youll get v[C]ery fat (very fat)
Now, the [C]coconut nut is a [F]big, big nut
But this de[G]licious nut is [F]not a [C]nut
[G                    C]
Its the c[G]oco fruit (its the co[C]co fruit)
Of the [G]coco tree (of the [C]coco tree)
From the [G]coco palm [F]fami[C]ly (yayayayaya)
[C                   F]
There are [C]so many uses of the [F]coconut tree
You can [G]build a bigger house for the [C]family
All you [C]need is to find a [F]coconut man
If he [G]cuts the tree, he [F]gets the fruits f[C]ree
[G                    C]
Its the c[G]oco fruit (its the co[C]co fruit)
Of the [G]coco tree (of the [C]coco tree)
From the [G]coco palm [F]fami[C]ly (yayayayaya)
[Interlude:] C#            F#      G#        C#
[(Co-conut]F#      G# [cococococonut]      [coconut[–])]   C#    
[Verse 3:]
The [C#]coconut bark for the [F#] kitchen floor
If you [G#]save some of it, you can [C#]build a door
Now, the [C#]coconut trunk, do not t[F#]hrow this junk
If you [G#]save some of it, youll have a s[F#]econd fl[C#]oor
[Verse 4:]
The [C#]coconut wood is [F#]very good
It can s[G#]tand 20 years if you [C#]pray it wood
Now, the [C#]coconut root, to [F#]tell you the truth
You can th[G#]row it or use it as [F#]fire[C#]wood
[Verse 5:]
The [C#]coconut leaves good [F#]shade it gives
For the [G#]roof, for the walls up a[C#]gainst the eaves
Now, the [C#]coconut fruit, say my [F#]relatives
Make good [G#]cannonballs up a[F#]gainst the t[C#]hieves
[Chorus:]
Its the c[G#]oco fruit (its the co[C#]co fruit)
Of the [G#]coco tree (of the [C#]coco tree)
From the [G#]coco palm [F#]fami[C#]ly (yayayayaya)
[D                G]
The [D]coconut nut is a [G]giant nut
If you [A]eat too much, youll get v[D]ery fat
Now, the [D]coconut nut is a [G]big, big nut
But this de[A]licious nut is [G]not a [D]nut
[Verse 7:]
The [D#]coconut nut is a [G#]giant nut
If you [A#]eat too much, youll get v[D#]ery fat
Now, the [D#]coconut nut is a [G#]big, big nut
But this de[A#]licious nut is [G#]not a [D#]nut
[Chorus (3x):]
Its the c[A#]oco fruit (its the co[D#]co fruit)
Of the [A#]coco tree (of the [D#]coco tree)
From the [A#]coco palm [G#]fami[D#]ly (yayayayaya)
[Outro:]
([D#]Lalala la lala [G#]lala la)
(La la [A#] la lalala la l[D#]a la lala) Olé!
