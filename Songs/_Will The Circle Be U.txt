When I saw the hearse come[Em] rolling
For to[G] carry my[D7] mother [G]away.

Theres a better home [Em]awaiting
In the[G] sky Lord,[D7] in the[G] sky.
Well, I went[G] back home, home was[G7] lonely
For my[C] mother she was[G] gone
And all my family there was[Em] cryin
For our[G] home felt[D7] sad and [G]alone.

Wont you [C]please drive [G]slow
For that lady you are[Em] haulin
Lord, I[G] hate to[D7] see her[G] go.
Will the[G] circle be u[G7]nbroken?
By and[C] by Lord, by and[G] by
Theres a better home [Em]awaiting
In the[G] sky Lord,[D7] in the[G] sky.
