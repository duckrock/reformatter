Wish You Were Here Chords By Pink Floyd @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com
[Intro]
[Em7  G  Em7  G  Em7  A7sus4  Em7  A7sus4  G       x2]
[Verse 1]
[C]So, so you think you can [D/F#]tell,
Heaven from [Am/E]Hell, blue skies from p[G]ain.
Can you tell a green[D/F#] field from a cold steel r[C]ail, a smile from a v[Am]eil,
Do you think you can [G]tell?
[Verse 2]
Did they get you to t[C]rade your heroes for[D/F#] ghosts,
Hot ashes for t[Am/E]rees, hot air for a co[G]ol breeze, cold comfort for ch[D/F#]ange,
And did you excha[C]nge a walk on part in the[Am] war for a lead role in a c[G]age?
[Instrumental]
[Em7  G  Em7  G  Em7  A7sus4  Em7  A7sus4  G]
[Verse 3]
[C]How I wish, how I wish you were[D/F#] here.
Were just [Am/E]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, [G]year after year, [D/F#]     
Running over the same old ground.[C] What have we found?
The same old[Am] fears. Wish you were here![G]  
[Instrumental]
