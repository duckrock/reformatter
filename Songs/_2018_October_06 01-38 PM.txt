[Verse 1]
Well some[D]times i go out by myself and i look across the water
And I [D]think of all the things,
What youre doing and in my head i make a p[Em]icture
[G                                       F#m]
Cause [G] since Ive come on home , well my bodys [F#m]been a mess
And Ive mi[G]ssed your tender hair and the [F#m]way you like to dress
Wo[G]nt you come on over st[F#m]op making a fool out of [A]me
Why wont you come on over V[D]alerie? Va[Em]lerie?
[D]
[D] Did you have to go to jail, put your house up for sale,
Did you get a good lawy[Em]er?
[D] I hope you didnt catch a tan
I hope you find the right man wholl fix [Em] it up for ya
[D] Are you shoppin anywhere,
Changed the colour of your hair , are y[Em]ou busy?
[D] And did you have to pay the fine
you were dodging all the time are you s[Em]till dizzy
[G                                F#m]
Cause si[G]nce Ive come on home , well my bo[F#m]dys been a mess
And Ive mi[G]ssed your tender hair and the [F#m]way you like to dress
W[G]ont you come on over [F#m] stop making a fool out of m[A]e 
Why wont you come on over V[D]alerie? Va[Em]lerie?
[D                                               Em]
Well som[D]etimes I go out by myself and I look across the [Em]water
And I [D]think of all the things,
What youre doing and in my head i make a p[Em]icture
[G                                F#m]
Cause s[G]ince Ive come on home , well my b[F#m]odys been a mess
