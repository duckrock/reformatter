I Love This Bar Chords - Toby Keith - Cowboy Lyrics
[D               A]
We got[D] winners, We got[A] losers,
[G] Chain smokers and[D] boozers,
We got[D] yuppies, We got[A] bikers, 
We got[G] thirsty hitc[A]hhikers.
And the[Bm] girls next door dress[A] up like movie[G] stars.
M-m[Em]-mm-[F#m]--mm--[G]-mm, I[A] love this[D] bar.
We got[D] cowboys, We got [A]truckers,
[G] Broken-hearted fools and[D] suckers,
We got[D] hustlers, We got[A] fighters,
[G] Early birds and all[A]-nighters,
And the[Bm] veterans talk [A]about their battle[G] scars.
M-m[Em]-mm-[F#m]--mm--[G]-mm, I[A] love this[D] bar.
[Bm]
I love this[Bm] bar.
Its my kind of [D]place.
Just[E7] walkin through the front door puts a [A]big smile on my face.
It aint too [Bm]far.
Come as you[D] are [G]. 
M-m[Em]-mm-[F#m]--mm--[G]-mm, I[A] love this[D] bar.
Ive seen [D]short skirts, We got [A]high techs,
[G] Blue collar boys and [D]rednecks.
We got[D] lovers, Lotsa[A] lookers,
Ive even [G]seen dancin girls and h[A]ookers.
And we[Bm] like to drink our[A] beer from a Mason[G] jar.
M-m[Em]-mm-[F#m]--mm--[G]-mm, I[A] love this[D] bar.  Yes, I do.
[Bm    D      Bm      D]
[Bm    D      Bm      D][A]
[D]
I like my[D] girl friend.
I like to[E7] take her out to dinner.
I like a[A] movie now and then.
But I love this[Bm] bar.
Its my kind of [D]place.
Just[E7] twirlin around the dance floor puts a [A]big smile on my face.
No cover [Bm]charge
Come as you[D] are [G]. 
M-m[Em]-mm-[F#m]--mm--[G]-mm, I[A] love this[D] bar.
M-m[Em]-mm-[F#m]--mm--[G]-mm, I just[A] love this old[D] bar.
