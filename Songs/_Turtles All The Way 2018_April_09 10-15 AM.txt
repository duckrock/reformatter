Turtles All The Way Down Chords - Sturgill Simpson - Cowboy Lyrics
Ive seen Jesus play with [E]flames in a lake of fire that I was standing in               [A]  
Met the [B7] devil in Seattle and spent 9 months inside the lions [E] den
Met [E] Buddha yet another time and he showed me a glowing light wit[A]hin
[B7] But I swear that God is there every time I glare in the eyes of my best [E] friend
[A] Says my son its all been done and someday yer gonna wake up old and [E]gray
So [A] go and try to have some fun showing warmth to everyone you meet and greet and cheat along the [E7] way
Theres a [E]gateway in our mind that leads somewhere out there beyond this [A]plane
Where [B7] reptile aliens made of light cut you open and pull out all your [E] pain
Tell me [E] how you make illegal something that we all make in our [A] brain
Some [B7] say you might go crazy but then again it might make you go [E] sane
[A] Every time I take a look inside that old and fabled book
Im [A]blinded and reminded of the pain caused by some old man in the [E]sky
[A] Marijuana, LSD, psilocybin, DMT they all changed the way I see
But [A] loves the only thing that ever saved my [B7]life
So dont [E]waste your mind on nursery rhymes or fairy tales of blood and wine
Its [A]turtles all the [G#m]way down the [F#m]line
So to [A] each their own til we go home to other realms our souls must roam
[A] To and through the myth that we all call [B7] space and [E] time
