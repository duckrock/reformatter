[Intro]
[C G Dm Dm][C G Dm Dm]
[C                     Em7]
I [C] Kicked in his door at [Em7] 5 am
I\ve [F]come for my bike I told the repo man
My [C] 920s gonna take me [Em7]far today
You can [F] travel for miles and never leave L. [C] A.
[C G Dm Dm]
[Chorus]
Ive [C]come a long way, Ive c[Em7]ome a long way
Ive [F]gone 500 miles today
Ive [C]come a long way, Ive c[Em7]ome a long way
And [F] never even left L. A.
[C G Dm Dm]
[Verse]
I [C] drive by the Plaza where the [Em7] gay boys pose
[F] Stand in their windows wearing no clothes
I [C] heard the screams of the [Em7] dying dark
Through the [F] sweet green icing of MacArthur Park
And then I [C] crossed the river into [Em7] East L. A.
Pe[F]scado mojado me encontre
And Im [C]given up on [Em7]rock n roll
And Im [F]saving up for norte√±o
The [C] river she runs by the [Em7] railroad tracks
I [F] swear Ill never take it back
A [C] train, she cries on the [Em7] midnight hour
[F] All along the Watts Tow---er
[C G Dm Dm]
[C G Dm Dm][C G Dm Dm]
[C                     Em7]
Ive [C]come a long way, Ive c[Em7]ome a long way
Ive [F]gone 500 miles today
Ive [C]come a long way, Ive c[Em7]ome a long way
And [F] never even left L. A.
[C                  Em7]
I [C] darted down to San [Em7] Pedro Bay
[F] Watched my ship sail in, watched her sail away
The [C] sun was sinking in[Em7]-to the sea
[F] But a ball of fire inside of me
Was [C] burning my motor and [Em7] driving me hard
[F] Past the big hair on the Boulevard
And [C] up Mulholland where I [Em7] made the scene
[F] Like the one that took little Jimmy Dean
And then I [C] shimmied up Wilshire like a [Em7] little silk worm
Past the [F] rodeo and the pachyderm
And then I [C] stopped for coffee at an [Em7] art cafe
I saw the [F] repo man and made my getaway
Doing the [C] Eagle Rock, heading [Em7] for the hills
Oh [F] tried to let my engines cool
And it is [C] not my fault that [Em7] this town shakes
I saw the [F] falling rock and I [C] hit my [G] brakes
[C                     Em7]
Ive [C]come a long way, Ive c[Em7]ome a long way
Ive [F]gone 500 miles today
Ive [C]come a long way, Ive c[Em7]ome a long way
And [F] never even left L. A.
[C                  Dm]
Now you [C] tow it to the repo [Dm] mans front door
[C                  Em7]
You [C] tow it to the repo [Em7] mans front door
And you [Dm] give him these keys, I dont need em no m[G]ore...
[C                     Em7]
Ive [C]come a long way, Ive c[Em7]ome a long way
Ive [F]gone 500 miles today
Ive [C]come a long way, Ive c[Em7]ome a long way
And [F] never even left L. A. ...
