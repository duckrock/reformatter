[C]I hope this old [G]train breaks down
[Am]Then I could take a[Fm] walk around
[C]And, see what there [G]is to see
[Am]And time is just a [Fm]melody
[C]All the people in the street
[G]Walk as fast as their feet can take them
[Am]I just roam through t[Fm]own
[C]And though my windows got a view
[G]The frame im looking through
[Am]Seems to have no concern for me[Fm] now

[Verse 3]
[C]But you cant stop nothing
[G]If you got no control
[Am]Of the thoughts in your mind
[Fm]That you kept in, you know
[C]You dont know nothing
[G]But you dont need to know
[Am]The wisdoms in the trees
[Fm]Not the glass windows
[C]You cant stop wishing
[G]If you dont let go
[Am]But things that you find
[Fm]And you lose, and you know
[C]You keep on rolling
[G]Put the moment on hold
[Am]The frames too bright
[Fm]So put the blinds down low
[Verse 4]
[C]I, [G]need this here

[C]I, [G]need this here
[Am]Old train to b[Fm]reakdown
[C]Oh, [G]please just
[Am]Let me please b[Fm]reakdown
[C]I wanna break on [G]down
[Am]But I cant stop[Fm] now
