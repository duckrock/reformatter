Amie Chords By Pure Prairie League @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com
[Verse]
[A]I can see why [G]you think [D]you [A]belong to [G]me. [D]  
[A]I never tried to [G]make you t[D]hink or [A]let you see one thing for yo[D]urself.
But now you’re [C]off with someone else and I’m a[D]lone.
You see I t[C]hought that I could keep you for my [E]own.
[Chorus]
[A]Amie, [G]what you wanna[D] do?  [A]I think that I [G]could stay with [D]you,
for a [Bm]while maybe longer if I [E]do…
[Verse]
[A]Don’t you think the [G]time is [D]right for us[A] to find.[G]    [D]  
[A]All the thi[G]ngs w[D]e thought weren’t proper c[A]ould be right in time and can [D]you see,
[D]Which way[C] we should turn together or a[D]lone?
I can n[C]ever see what’s right or what is w[E]rong…
[Chorus]
[A]Amie, [G]what you wanna[D] do?  [A]I think that I [G]could stay with [D]you,
for a [Bm]while maybe longer if I [E]do…
[(Break/solo-good luck)]
[Chorus]
[A]Amie, [G]what you wanna[D] do?  [A]I think that I [G]could stay with [D]you,
for a [Bm]while maybe longer if I [E]do…
[Verse]
[A]Now it’s come to [G]what you [D]want, you’ve had[A] yer way.[G]     [D]  
[A]And all the things you’re fi[G]ght’n fo[D]r just fa[A]ded into gray and can you [D]see,
that I [C]don’t know if it’s you or if it’s[D] me?
If it’s [C]one of us, I’m sure we both will [E]see…
[Chorus X2]
[A]Amie, [G]what you wanna[D] do?  [A]I think that I [G]could stay with [D]you,
for a [Bm]while maybe longer if I [E]do…
[Outro]
[E]I keep, f[A(finger]allin’ in[picking)] and out of[G] love with [D]you. [A] Fallin’ in and out of[G] love w[D]ith you.
[A]Don’t  know what I’m gonna [G]do…   [D]
