[G] I lit out from Reno, I was [C] trailed by twenty hounds
[G] Didnt get to sleep last night till the m[C]orning came around.
[D] Set out runnin but I take my time
A [Am] friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If [D] I get home before daylight, I [Am] just might get some [C] sleep t[D]onight.
[G] Ran into the devil, babe, he [C] loaned me twenty bills
I [G] spent the night in Utah in a [C] cave up in the hills.
[D] Set out runnin but I take my time

I [G] ran down to the levee but the [C] devil caught me there
He [G] took my twenty dollar bill and [C] vanished in the air.
[D] Set out runnin but I take my time
A [Am] friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If [D] I get home before daylight, I [Am] just might get some [C] sleep t[D]onight.
[D] Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night,
The [C] first ones named Sweet Anne Marie, and shes my hearts delight.
The [D] second one is prison, babe, the sheriffs on my trail,
And [Am] if he catches up with me, Ill [C]spend my life in [D]jail.
