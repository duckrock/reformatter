Pina Colada Escape Chords By Jack Johnson @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com

[Intro]
You know I love my lady, b[D]ut weve been together to l[A]ong
Like a worn out rec[D]ording of a favorite [A]song
So while she lay there sle[D]epin I read the paper in b[A]ed
And in the personal co[D]lumns, there was this letter I [A]read 
[Pause...]
If you like pi�a c[D]oladas and getting caught in the r[A]ain
If youre not into yo[D]ga, if you have half a br[A]ain
If you like making love at mi[D]dnight in the dunes of the [A]cape
Then Im the love that youve looked fo[D]r, write to me and esc[A]ape
[Riff/intro]
I didnt think about my la[D]dy, I know that sounds kind of m[A]ean
But me and my old [D]lady had fallen into the same old dull r[A]outine
So I wrote to the p[D]aper, took out a personal [A]ad
And though Im nobodys po[D]et, I thought it wasnt half bad[A]  
[Pause...]
Yes, I like pi�a coladas[D] and getting caught in the r[A]ain
Im not much into health fo[D]od, I am into champ[A]agne
Ive got to meet you by tomorro[D]w and cut through all this red t[A]ape
At a bar called OMall[D]eys where well plan our escap[A]e 
[Riff/Intro...]
So I waited with high h[D]opes and she walked in the pl[A]ace
I knew her smile in an i[D]nstant, I knew the curve of her f[A]ace
It was my own lovely l[D]ady and she said, Aw, it\s you.[A]  
Then we laughed for a [D]moment and I said, I never knew[A]. 
I never knew That you like pi�a cola[D]das and gettin\ caught in the rai[A]n 
And the feel of the o[D]cean and the taste of ch[A]ampagne
If you like making love at mi[D]dnight in the dunes on the c[A]ape
Youre the lady Ive looked fo[D]r, come with me and esca[A]pe
If you like pi�a col[D]adas and getting caught in the r[A]ain
If youre not into yo[D]ga, if you have half a br[A]ain
If you like making love at mid[D]night in the dunes on the [A]cape
Then Im the love that youve looked fo[D]r, write to me and es[A]cape
Yes I like pi�a cola[D]das and getting caught in the r[A]ain
Im not much into health f[D]ood, I am into champa[A]gne
Ive got to meet you by tomor[D]row and cut through all this red t[A]ape
[Thanks]Commen[guys!!]t and l[Hope]et me[you] kno[got]w if[it] it[down.] was helpfull.
