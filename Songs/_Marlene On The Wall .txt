[Intro]
[E  Esus4  F#m  A]
[Verse 1]
[E]Even if I am in love with you
All [Esus4]this to say, whats it to you?
Ob[F#m]serve the blood, the rose tattoo
Of the f[A]ingerprints on me from you
[E]Other evidence has shown
Tha[Esus4]t you and I are still alone
[F#m]We skirt around the danger zone
And dont [A]talk about it later [Em7]    
[Chorus]
Marlene watches from the wall[Cmaj7]      
Her mocking smile says it [Bm7]all 
As the records the rise and [Cmaj7]fall  
Of every soldier passin[Em7]g   
But the only soldier now i[Cmaj7]s me  
Im fighting things I cannot [Bm7]see 
I think its called my desti[Cmaj7]ny    
That I am cha[Cmaj7]nging [D]  
[Bm7]Marlene on the [Cmaj7]wall  
[Verse 2]
Well I [E]walk to your house in the afternoon
By the butc[Esus4]hers shop with the sawdust strewn
Don\t gi[F#m]ve away the goods too soon
Is w[A]hat she might have told me
And I [E]tried so hard to resist
When you [Esus4]held me in your handsome fist
And r[F#m]eminded me of the night we kissed
And of [A]why I should be leaving[Em7]    
[Chorus]
Marlene watches from the wa[Cmaj7]ll    
Her mocking smile says it [Bm7]all 
As the records the rise and [Cmaj7]fall  
Of every soldier passin[Em7]g   
But the only soldier now i[Cmaj7]s me  
Im fighting things I cannot [Bm7]see 
I think its called my desti[Cmaj7]ny    
That I am cha[Cmaj7]nging [D]  
[Bm7]Marlene on the [Cmaj7]wall    [Bm7]      [Cmaj7]      
[Instrumental]
[E    Esus4   F#m   A   Em7]
[Chorus]
Marlene watches from the wa[Cmaj7]ll    
Her mocking smile says it [Bm7]all 
As the records the rise and [Cmaj7]fall  
Of every soldier passin[Em7]g   
But the only soldier now i[Cmaj7]s me  
Im fighting things I cannot [Bm7]see 
I think its called my desti[Cmaj7]ny    
That I am cha[Cmaj7]nging [D]
