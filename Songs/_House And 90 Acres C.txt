[Em]Ive got a house and 90 [C]acres [D]some cattle in the [Em]barn
[Em]Two kids with no[C] mama, she[D] left in a salemans [Em]arms
A[C] sign by the[G] mailbox says theres an [C]auction in the [G]yard
[Em]Born and raised has[C] been damn easy but[D] lately livings [Em]hard
[Em]The children miss their[C] mama but there aint [D]nothing I can [Em]do 
[Em]If she was all I had to[C] worry about well Id [D]guess Id miss her t[Em]oo 
But Ive [C]watched my tools and [G]tractor leave in [C]someone elses h[G]ands
[Em]I grit my teeth,[C] Im let em go but I w[D]ont give up my la[C]nd
[G]This house and 90 acres, the only[D] place Ive left to stand
My[Em] roots are anchored[C] solid, I aint [D]machinery Im a m[C]an
[G]Ill be here in the morning come [D]pouring rain or sun
This[Em] house and 90[C] acres
Whats [D]said is good as done

[Em]Or I could move 300[C] miles from home but[D] that would be giving[Em] up
Well you[C] know that I aint [G]leaving if its j[C]ust my pride I s[G]ave
[Em]I might be on the[C] front porch or I might[D] be in a hillside[C] grave
[G]This house and 90 acres, the only[D] place Ive left to stand
My[Em] roots are anchored[C] solid, I aint [D]machinery Im a m[C]an
[G]Ill be here in the morning come [D]pouring rain or sun
This[Em] house and 90[C] acres
Whats [D]said is good as done
This[Em] house and 90[C] acres
Whats [D]said is good as done
