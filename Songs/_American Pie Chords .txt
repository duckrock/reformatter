[Verse 1]
A[G] long,[D/F#] long ti[Em7]me ago, 
[Am]I can still r[C]emember how that mu[Em]sic used to make me [D]smile
And[G] I know[D/F#] if I h[Em7]ad my chance,
That[Am] I could make those[C] people dance and[Em] maybe theyd be [C]happy for a w[D]hile              
But[Em] February[Am] made me shiver,[Em] with every paper I[Am]d deliver
[C]Bad news[G] on the[Am] doorstep, I co[C]uldnt take one more st[D]ep
I[G] cant remem[D/F#]ber if I [Em]cried when I [Am7]read about his [D]widowed bride
[G]Something[D] touched me[Em] deep inside
The[C] day th[D7]e music [G]died
[Chorus]
So[G] bye,[C] bye Miss[G] American[D] Pie
Drove my[G] Chevy to the[C] levy but the[G] levy was[D] dry
And them[G] good old[C] boys were drinkin [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie 
[Verse 2]
[G]Did you write the[Am] book of love
And do[C] you have faith in[Am] god above,[Em] if the bible[D] tells you so?
[G]Do you[D/F#] believe in [Em]rock and roll
Can[Am7] music save you[C]r mortal soul and can [Em]you teach me how to danc[A7]e real slo[D]w?
Well I[Em*] know that youre in l[D*]ove with him  cuz I sa[Em*]w you dancin in [D*]the gym
You[C] both kicked[G] off your[A7] shoes, man I[C] dig those rhythm and[D7] blues
I was a[G] lonely[D/F#] teenage [Em]broncin buck with a p[Am]ink carnation and a p[C]ickup truck
But[G] I kne[D/F#]w I was [Em]out of luck the [C]day the [D7]music [G]die[C]d, [G]I started singin
[Chorus]
So[G] bye,[C] bye Miss[G] American[D] Pie
Drove my[G] Chevy to the[C] levy but the[G] levy was[D] dry
And them[G] good old[C] boys were drinkin [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie 
[Verse 3]
Now for [G]ten years weve been [Am]on our own,
and m[C]oss grows fat on a r[Am]olling stone[Em] but thats not how it u[D]sed to be
When the [G]jester[D/F#] sang for the ki[Em]ng and queen 
in a[Am7] coat he borrowed f[C]rom James Dean in a [Em]voice that came[A7] from you an[D]d me
And [Em*]while the king was l[D*]ooking down, the [Em*]jester stole his tho[D*]rny crown
The [C]courtroom[G] was adjour[A7]ned, n[C]o verdict was [D7]returned
And while[G] Lenin re[D/F#]ad a b[Em]ook on Marx, th[Am]e quartet pra[C]cticed in the park
And[G] we sang [D/F#]dirges [Em]in the dark the[C] day the m[D7]usic di[G]ed,[C] we[G] were singin
[Chorus]
So[G] bye,[C] bye Miss[G] American[D] Pie
Drove my[G] Chevy to the[C] levy but the[G] levy was[D] dry
And them[G] good old[C] boys were drinkin [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie 
[Verse 4]
[G]Helter skelter in a[Am] summer swelter
[C]the birds flew off wit[Am]h a fallout shelter[Em], eight miles high and [D]fallin fast
It la[G]nded[D/F#] foul [Em]on the grass
the p[Am7]layers tried for a [C]forward pass,[Em] with the jester on the sidelin[A7]es in a[D] cast
Now at h[Em*]alftime there was [D*]sweet perfume, while[Em*] sergeants played a [D*]marching tune
[C]We all got[G] up to da[A7]nce, but[C] we never got the c[D7]hance
Cuz the p[G]layers [D/F#]tried to t[Em]ake the field, the [Am]marching band re[C]fused to yield
Do [G]you r[D/F#]ecall what [Em]was the feel the[C] day the [D7]music die[G]d, [C]   [G]we started singin
[Chorus]
So[G] bye,[C] bye Miss[G] American[D] Pie
Drove my[G] Chevy to the[C] levy but the[G] levy was[D] dry
And them[G] good old[C] boys were drinkin [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie 
[Verse 5]
And [G]there we were all[Am] in one place,
a g[C]eneration[Am] lost in space[Em], with no time left t[D]o start again
So come on [G]Jack be[D/F#] nimble[Em], Jack be quick, [Am7]Jack Flash sat on a [C]candle 
stick,[Em] cuz fire is the devi[A7]ls only friend [D]  
And [Em*]as I watched him [D*]on the stage, my [Em*]hands were clenched in [D*]fists of rage
No[C] angel [G]born in [A7]Hell could [C]break that Satans s[D7]pell
And as the[G] flames climb[D/F#]ed high in[Em]to the night to[Am] light the sacri[C]ficial rite
I saw [G]Sata[D/F#]n laughing with[Em] delight the [C]day the[D7] music d[G]ied[C],  [G]   he was singin
[Chorus]
So[G] bye,[C] bye Miss[G] American[D] Pie
Drove my[G] Chevy to the[C] levy but the[G] levy was[D] dry
And them[G] good old[C] boys were drinkin [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie 
[Verse 6]
I[G] met [D/F#]a girl who [Em]sang the blues
And I[Am] asked her for some[C] happy news, but[Em] she just smiled and tur[D]ned away
I[G] went do[D/F#]wn to the [Em]sacred store   
Where [Am]Id heard the mus[C]ic years before, but t[Em]he man there said t[C]he music
wouldnt [D]play
But[Em*] in the streets the[Am*] children screamed, the[Em*] lovers cried and the[Am*] poets dreamed
But[C] not a[G] word was[Am] spoken, the[C] church bells all were[D] broken                                     
And the[G] three m[D/F#]en I ad[Em]mire most, the[Am7] Father,[C] Son, and the [D7]Holy Ghost
[G]They caught t[D/F#]he last train [Em]for the coast the[Am7] day the[D7] music[G] died,
[N.C.]And they were singin
[Chorus]
So[G] bye,[C] bye Miss[G] American[D] Pie
Drove my[G] Chevy to the[C] levy but the[G] levy was[D] dry
And them[G] good old[C] boys were drinkin [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie 
So[G] bye,[C] bye Miss[G] American[D] Pie
Drove my[G] Chevy to the[C] levy but the[G] levy was[D] dry
And them[G] good old[C] boys were drinkin [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin [C]this will be the [D7]day that I [G]die.[C]    [G]
