[Old]Stu[King]rgill[Coal] Simpson
[Verse 1]
[E]Many a man down in these here hills
Made a living off that[B7] old black[E] gold
[E]Now there aint nothing but welfare and pills
And the wind never[B7] felt so[E] cold
[Verse 2]
Ill be [E]one of the first in a long long line
Not to go down from that[B7] old black[E] lung
My[E] death will be slower than the rest of my kind
And my life will be sadder than the[B7] songs they all[E] sung[E/F#]      [E/G#]     
[Chorus]
[A]Old King Coal what are[E] we gonna do
When the mountains are gone and[B7] so are[E] you [E/F#]      [E/G#]     
They[A] come from the city[E] to lend a hand
Carrying signs saying, Shut the mines [B7]down
We aint [A]looking for pity and you [E]dont u[E/F#]n  -  d[E/G#]er - s[A]tand
So go[E] back to your city now cause[B7] this aint your [E]town
[Instrumental]
[A   E   E   B7  E]
[Verse 3]
[E]My Great Grandfather spent his days in a coal mine
And his nights on the[B7] porch in a[E] chair
[E]Now hes in heaven and down here in hell
The[B7] rivers run muddy and the[A] moun -[A/G#] tains [A/F#] are  [E] bare [E/F#]       [E/G#]     
[Chorus]
[A]Old King Coal what are[E] we gonna do
When the mountains are gone and[B7] so are[E] you [E/F#]      [E/G#]     
[A]Old King Coal what are[E] we gonna do
When the mountains are gone and[B7] so are[E] you
